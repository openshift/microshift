          IstioCSR describes the configuration and information about the managed istio-csr agent.
          The name must be `default` to make IstioCSR a singleton that is, to allow only one instance of IstioCSR per namespace.

          When an IstioCSR is created, istio-csr agent is deployed in the IstioCSR-created namespace.
