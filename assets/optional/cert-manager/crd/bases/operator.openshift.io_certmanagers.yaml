                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
