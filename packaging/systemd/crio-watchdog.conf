# CRIO 1.32 started using systemd watchdog with 60s timeout.
# At the time of writing this, CRIO's internal watchdog takes CNI's status into consideration
# which means that there's only 60 seconds from CRIO starting for MicroShift to
# start, fetch ovn-k image, and start the ovn-k CNI.
# This is not enough.
# As a temporary workaround, we disable CRIO's watchdog until CRIO's internal
# watchdog logic is separate from CNI status.
# See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48334
