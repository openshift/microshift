apiServer:
    # Kube apiserver advertise address to work around the certificates issue when requiring external access using the node IP. This will turn into the IP configured in the endpoint slice for kubernetes service. Must be a reachable IP from pods. Defaults to service network CIDR first address.

dns:
    # baseDomain is the base domain of the cluster. All managed DNS records will be sub-domains of this base. 
    #  For example, given the base domain `example.com`, router exposed domains will be formed as `*.apps.example.com` by default, and API service will have a DNS entry for `api.example.com`, as well as "api-int.example.com" for internal k8s API access. 
    #  Once set, this field cannot be changed.
    # example:
    #   microshift.example.com
    baseDomain: example.com
