				Description: heredoc.Doc(`
					OpenShift provides builds, application lifecycle, image content management,
					and administrative policy on top of Kubernetes. The API allows consistent
					management of those objects.

					All API operations are authenticated via an Authorization	bearer token that
					is provided for service accounts as a generated secret (in JWT form) or via
					the native OAuth endpoint located at /oauth/authorize. Core infrastructure
					components may use client certificates that require no authentication.

					All API operations return a 'resourceVersion' string that represents the
					version of the object in the underlying storage. The standard LIST operation
					performs a snapshot read of the underlying objects, returning a resourceVersion
					representing a consistent version of the listed objects. The WATCH operation
					allows all updates to a set of objects after the provided resourceVersion to
					be observed by a client. By listing and beginning a watch from the returned
					resourceVersion, clients may observe a consistent view of the state of one
					or more objects. Note that WATCH always returns the update after the provided
					resourceVersion. Watch may be extended a limited time in the past - using
					etcd 2 the watch window is 1000 events (which on a large cluster may only
					be a few tens of seconds) so clients must explicitly handle the "watch
					to old error" by re-listing.

					Objects are divided into two rough categories - those that have a lifecycle
					and must reflect the state of the cluster, and those that have no state.
					Objects with lifecycle typically have three main sections:

					* 'metadata' common to all objects
					* a 'spec' that represents the desired state
					* a 'status' that represents how much of the desired state is reflected on
					  the cluster at the current time

					Objects that have no state have 'metadata' but may lack a 'spec' or 'status'
					section.

					Objects are divided into those that are namespace scoped (only exist inside
					of a namespace) and those that are cluster scoped (exist outside of
					a namespace). A namespace scoped resource will be deleted when the namespace
					is deleted and cannot be created if the namespace has not yet been created
					or is in the process of deletion. Cluster scoped resources are typically
					only accessible to admins - resources like nodes, persistent volumes, and
					cluster policy.

					All objects have a schema that is a combination of the 'kind' and
					'apiVersion' fields. This schema is additive only for any given version -
					no backwards incompatible changes are allowed without incrementing the
					apiVersion. The server will return and accept a number of standard
					responses that share a common schema - for instance, the common
					error type is 'metav1.Status' (described below) and will be returned
					on any error from the API server.

					The API is available in multiple serialization formats - the default is
					JSON (Accept: application/json and Content-Type: application/json) but
					clients may also use YAML (application/yaml) or the native Protobuf
					schema (application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf). Note that the format
					of the WATCH API call is slightly different - for JSON it returns newline
					delimited objects while for Protobuf it returns length-delimited frames
					(4 bytes in network-order) that contain a 'versioned.Watch' Protobuf
					object.

					See the OpenShift documentation at https://docs.openshift.org for more
					information.
