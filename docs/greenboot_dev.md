# Testing MicroShift Integration with Greenboot

## Motivation

[Integrating MicroShift with Greenboot](./greenboot.md) allows for automatic
software upgrade rollbacks in case of a failure.

The current document describes a few techniques for:
* Adding user workload health check procedures in a production environment
* Simulating software upgrade failures in a development environment

These guidelines can be used by developers for implementing user workload
health check using Greenboot facilities, as well as simulating failures for
testing MicroShift integration with Greenboot in CI/CD pipelines.

## User Workload Health

### Installation

Follow the instructions in [Auto-applying Manifests](./howto_config.md#auto-applying-manifests)
section to install a dummy user workload, without restarting the MicroShift service
at this time.

Proceed by creating a health check script in the `/etc/greenboot/check/required.d`
directory.
> The name prefix of the user script should be chosen to make sure it runs after
> the `40_microshift_running_check.sh` script, which implements the MicroShift
> health check procedure for its core services.

```
SCRIPT_FILE=/etc/greenboot/check/required.d/50_busybox_running_check.sh
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/microshift/main/docs/config/busybox_running_check.sh \
  -o ${SCRIPT_FILE} && echo SUCCESS || echo ERROR
sudo chmod 755 ${SCRIPT_FILE}
```

### Testing

Reboot the system and run the following command to examine the output of the
Greenboot health checks. Note that the MicroShift core service health checks
are running before the user workload health checks.

```bash
sudo journalctl -o cat -u greenboot-healthcheck.service
```

### Health Check Implementation

The script utilizes the MicroShift health check functions that are available
in the `/usr/share/microshift/functions/greenboot.sh` file to reuse procedures
already implemented for the MicroShift core services. These functions need a
definition of the user workload namespaces and the expected count of pods.

```bash
PODS_NS_LIST=(busybox)
PODS_CT_LIST=(1      )
```

The script starts by running sanity checks to verify that it is executed from
the `root` account and that the MicroShift service is enabled.

Finally, the MicroShift health check functions are called to perform the
following actions:
- Get a wait timeout of the current boot cycle for the `wait_for` function
- Call the `namespace_images_downloaded` function to wait until pod images are available
- Call the `namespace_pods_ready` function to wait until pods are ready
- Call the `namespace_pods_not_restarting` function to verify pods are not restarting

## MicroShift Service Failure

To simulate a situation with the MicroShift service failure after an upgrade,
one can remove the `hostname` RPM package used by MicroShift during its startup.

Run the following command to remove the package and reboot.

```bash
sudo rpm-ostree override remove hostname -r
```

Examine the system log to monitor the upgrade verification procedure that will fail
and reboot a few times before rolling back into the previous state. Note the values
of `boot_success` and `boot_counter` GRUB variables.

```
$ sudo journalctl -o cat -u greenboot-healthcheck.service
...
...
Running Required Health Check Scripts...
STARTED
GRUB boot variables:
boot_success=0
boot_indeterminate=0
boot_counter=2
...
...
Waiting 300s for MicroShift service to be active and not failed
FAILURE
...
...
```

> Run the `sudo journalctl -o cat -u redboot-task-runner.service` command
> to see the output of the pre-rollback script.

After a few failed verification attempts, the system should roll back into the
previous state. Use the `rpm-ostree` command to verify the current deployment.

```bash
$ rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
  edge:rhel/9/x86_64/edge
                  Version: 9.1 (2022-12-26T10:28:32Z)
                     Diff: 1 removed
      RemovedBasePackages: hostname 3.20-6.el8

* edge:rhel/9/x86_64/edge
                  Version: 9.1 (2022-12-26T10:28:32Z)
```

Finish by checking that all MicroShift pods run normally and cleaning up
the failed rollback deployment.

```bash
sudo rpm-ostree cleanup -b -r
```

## MicroShift Pod Failure

To simulate a situation with the MicroShift pod failure after an upgrade,
one can set the `network.serviceNetwork` MicroShift configuration option to a
non-default `10.66.0.0/16` value without resetting the MicroShift data at the
`/var/lib/microshift` directory.

Start by checking out the current file system state and modifying it by adding
the `config.yaml` file to its `usr/etc/microshift` directory.

```bash
NEW_BRANCH="microshift-config"
OSTREE_REF=$(ostree refs | head -1)
OSTREE_COM=$(ostree log ${OSTREE_REF} | grep ^commit | awk '{print $2}')

sudo ostree checkout ${OSTREE_COM} ${NEW_BRANCH}
pushd ${NEW_BRANCH}

sudo tee usr/etc/microshift/config.yaml &>/dev/null <<EOF
network:
  serviceNetwork:
  - 10.66.0.0/16
EOF
```

Commit the updated file system, clean up the checked out tree and compare the
base reference with the newly created one to verify that the `config.yaml` file
was added at the `/usr/etc/microshift` directory.

```bash
sudo ostree commit --subject="MicroShift config.yaml update" --branch="${NEW_BRANCH}"
popd && sudo rm -rf ${NEW_BRANCH}

ostree diff ${OSTREE_REF} ${NEW_BRANCH}
```

Switch to the new branch as the default deployment and reboot for changes to
become effective.

```bash
BRANCH_COM=$(ostree log ${NEW_BRANCH} | grep ^commit | awk '{print $2}')
sudo rpm-ostree rebase --branch=${NEW_BRANCH} ${BRANCH_COM} -r
```

Examine the system log to monitor the upgrade verification procedure that will fail
and reboot a few times before rolling back into the previous state. Note the pod
readiness failure in the `openshift-ingress` namespace.

```
$ sudo journalctl -o cat -u greenboot-healthcheck.service
...
...
Running Required Health Check Scripts...
STARTED
...
...
Waiting 300s for 1 pod(s) from the 'openshift-ingress' namespace to be in 'Ready' state

```

After a few failed verification attempts, the system should roll back into the
previous state. Use the `rpm-ostree` command to verify the current deployment.

```bash
$ rpm-ostree status

```

Finish by checking that all MicroShift pods run normally and cleaning up
the failed rollback deployment.

```bash
NEW_BRANCH="microshift-config"
sudo rpm-ostree cleanup -b -r
sudo ostree refs --delete ${NEW_BRANCH}
```
