# Deploying MicroShift Behind HTTP(S) Proxy
When deploying MicroShift behind a proxy, it is necessary to configure the host OS to use this proxy for the components initiating HTTP(S) requests.
> All the user-specific workloads or PODs with egress traffic (e.g. HTTP(S) access to cloud services) should be explicitly configured to use the proxy. There is no built-in transparent proxying of egress traffic in MicroShift.

## CRI-O Container Engine
To use an HTTP(S) proxy in `CRI-O`, you need to set the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.
> Optionally set the `NO_PROXY` variable to exclude a list of hosts from being proxied

Add the following settings to the `/etc/systemd/system/crio.service.d/00-proxy.conf` file.
```
[Service]
Environment=NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1"
Environment=HTTP_PROXY="http://$PROXY_USER:$PROXY_PASSWORD@$PROXY_SERVER:$PROXY_PORT/"
Environment=HTTPS_PROXY="http://$PROXY_USER:$PROXY_PASSWORD@$PROXY_SERVER:$PROXY_PORT/"
```

Reload configuration and restart the service for the changes to take effect.
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart crio
```

## rpm-ostree Image/Package System
To use the HTTP(S) proxy in `rpm-ostree`, you need to set the `http_proxy` environment variable for the `rpm-ostreed` service.

Add the following setting to the `/etc/systemd/system/rpm-ostreed.service.d/00-proxy.conf` file.
```
[Service]
Environment="http_proxy=http://$PROXY_USER:$PROXY_PASSWORD@$PROXY_SERVER:$PROXY_PORT/"
```

Reload configuration and restart the service for the changes to take effect.
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart rpm-ostreed.service
```

## Testing Configuration
Use the instructions in the [Install MicroShift for Edge](./devenv_rhel8.md#install-microshift-for-edge) section to configure a virtual machine running MicroShift.

### Hypervisor Settings
Log into the hypervisor host and set up an `tinyproxy` server to be used as a forward proxy.
```
podman build -t tinyproxy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/microshift/main/docs/config/Containerfile.tinyproxy
podman run --rm -d --name tinyproxy -p 8443:8888 tinyproxy 
```

If the firewall is enabled, use the following commands to allow TCP traffic on port `8443` from the virtual machine network.
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=libvirt --add-port=8443/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
> A different firewall configuration may need to be applied if `libvirt` is not used as the virtualization platform.

### Virtual Machine Settings
Log into the virtual machine to configure `CRI-O` and `rpm-ostree` for using a proxy.

> The hypervisor host IP address should be used to denote a proxy server and its port in the `PROXY_IP` variable set below.
```
PROXY_IP=192.168.50.103:8443
```
Proceed by running the following commands.

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/crio.service.d/
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/rpm-ostreed.service.d/

sudo cat > /etc/systemd/system/crio.service.d/00-proxy.conf <<EOF
[Service]
Environment=NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1"
Environment=HTTP_PROXY="http://${PROXY_IP}"
Environment=HTTPS_PROXY="http://${PROXY_IP}"
EOF

sudo cat > /etc/systemd/system/rpm-ostreed.service.d/00-proxy.conf <<EOF
[Service]
Environment="http_proxy=http://${PROXY_IP}"
EOF
```

Restart the services for the settings to take effect.
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart crio
sudo systemctl restart rpm-ostreed.service
```
### Verify MicroShift
> Instructions in the section should be followed twice: with and without `tinyproxy` server running on the hypervisor host.
> `CRI-O` should only succeed pulling container images when the `tinyproxy` is running.

Log into the virtual machine to verify that MicroShift can run normally when `CRI-O` is configured to use HTTP(S) proxy.

Run the following commands to clean up the existing `CRI-O` images and restart MicroShift.
```
echo 1 | /usr/bin/cleanup-all-microshift-data
sudo systemctl enable microshift --now
```
Configure the MicroShift access and check if the PODs are up and running.
```
mkdir ~/.kube
sudo cat /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig > ~/.kube/config
oc get pods -A
```
