*** Comments ***
# NOTE: Unlike most suites, these tests rely on being run IN ORDER to
# ensure the host is in a good state at the start of each test. We
# could have separated them and run them as separate scenarios, but
# did not want to spend the resources on a new VM.
#
# The "Install Source Version" test wants to be run on a system where
# MicroShift has never been installed before to ensure that all of the
# dependencies are installed automatically. The test teardown step
# removes those RPMs, and then "Upgrade From Previous Version"
# installs the _older_ version of MicroShift and tries to upgrade it.
