*** Comments ***
# NOTE: Unlike most suites, these tests rely on being run IN ORDER to
# ensure the host is in a good state at the start of each test. We
# could have separated them and run them as separate scenarios, but
# did not want to spend the resources on a new VM.
#
# The "Install Source Version" test wants to be run on a system where
# MicroShift has never been installed before to ensure that all of the
# dependencies are installed automatically. The test teardown step
# removes those RPMs, and then "Upgrade From Previous Version"
# installs the _older_ version of MicroShift and tries to upgrade it.

Upgrade From Previous Version
    [Documentation]    Install the previous version, then upgrade the package
    ...    also verifying that crio and microshift services were restarted
    # Always install from system repo, because the scenario script
    # is enabling all the repositories needed.
    #
    # Ignore warnings when installing the previous version because we
    # know some of our older RPMs generate warnings. We care more
    # about warnings on the new RPM.
