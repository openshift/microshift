*** Test Cases ***
Verify MicroShift Runs On Both NICs
    [Documentation]    Verify MicroShift can run in the default configuration

    # Wait for MicroShift API readiness and run verification
    Wait For MicroShift
    Verify Hello MicroShift LB
    Verify Hello MicroShift NodePort    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP1}
    Verify Hello MicroShift NodePort    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP2}
    IP Should Be Present In External Certificate    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP1}
    IP Should Be Present In External Certificate    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP2}

Verify MicroShift Runs Only On Primary NIC
    [Documentation]    Verify MicroShift can run only on the primary NIC. The
    ...    node IP will be taken from this NIC by default. When disabling the
    ...    secondary NIC nothing will happen in MicroShift, as the IP did not
    ...    change. A restart is forced so that MicroShift picks up the new
    ...    configuration (without the secondary IP) and regenerates the
    ...    certificates, which will be lacking the IP from secondary NIC.
    [Setup]    Save Default MicroShift Config

    Configure Subject Alternative Name    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP1}

    ${cur_pid}=    MicroShift Process ID

    Login Switch To IP    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP1}
    Disable Interface    ${NIC2_NAME}

    Restart MicroShift

    Verify MicroShift On Single NIC    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP1}    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP2}

    [Teardown]    Restore Network Configuration By Rebooting Host

Verify MicroShift Runs Only On Secondary NIC
    [Documentation]    Verify MicroShift can run only on the secondary NIC. The
    ...    node IP will change when disabling the primary interface, triggering
    ...    an automatic restart of the service. After restarting, the node IP will
    ...    be that of the secondary NIC, and certificates will be updated according
    ...    to the new configuration (which includes only the secondary IP).
    [Setup]    Save Default MicroShift Config

    Configure Subject Alternative Name    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP2}

    ${cur_pid}=    MicroShift Process ID

    Login Switch To IP    ${USHIFT_HOST_IP2}
