*** Test Cases ***
Verify Load Balancer Services Are Running Correctly In Isolated Network
    [Documentation]    Verifies that isolated network does not negatively
    ...    impact Load Balancer Services.

    Setup Kubeconfig
    Create Load Balancer
    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    1m    5s
    ...    Check Load Balancer Service Access

    [Teardown]    Run Keywords
    ...    Delete Load Balancer

Verify MicroShift Is Healthy In Isolated Network After Clean And Reboot
    [Documentation]    Makes sure that MicroShift running in an isolated network
    ...    remains healthy after clean and reboot.

    Cleanup MicroShift
    Enable MicroShift
    Reboot MicroShift Host

    Verify No Internet Access
    Verify No Registry Access
    Wait Until Greenboot Health Check Exited


*** Keywords ***
Setup
    [Documentation]    Test suite setup
    Check Required Env Variables
    Login MicroShift Host

    Verify No Internet Access

    Wait Until Greenboot Health Check Exited

Teardown

Verify No Internet Access
    [Documentation]    Verifies that Internet is not accessible

Verify No Registry Access
    [Documentation]    Verifies that container registry is not accessible
    ...    also taking into account possible mirror registry presence.

    # Get a digest reference for a local image from quay.io.
    # It must exist because images are preloaded in isolated configurations.

    Run With Kubeconfig    oc create -f ${LB_CONFIG} -n ${LB_NSPACE}

Check Load Balancer Service Access
    [Documentation]    Checks if a load balancer service can be accessed.
    ${rc}=    Run And Return RC    curl -I ${USHIFT_HOST}:${LB_PORTNUM}
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${rc}    0
