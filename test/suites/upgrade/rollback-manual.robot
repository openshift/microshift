Manual Rollback Does Not Restore Data
    [Documentation]    Verifies that using rpm-ostree rollback will not
    ...    restore data automatically: making sure admin needs to perform
    ...    it manually.
    ...
    ...    Test expects that provided upgrade reference is within the same Y-stream,
    ...    e.g. 4.14.0 -> 4.14.1, not 4.14.0 -> 4.15.0.
    ...
    ...    Test will upgrade the system with provided reference, create ConfigMap,
    ...    roll system back to initial deployment, verify that ConfigMap exists,
    ...    create additional ConfigMap, roll system back to upgrade deployment
    ...    and verify that both ConfigMaps exist.
