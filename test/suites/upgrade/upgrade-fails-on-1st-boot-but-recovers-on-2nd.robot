First Failed Staged Upgrade Should Not Restore Backup
    [Documentation]    Staged deployment is unhealthy on first boot.
    ...    After auto-greenboot-reboot MicroShift should not restore
    ...    rollback deployment's backup, instead it should just carry on with
    ...    the existing data.

    Wait Until Greenboot Health Check Exited

    ${initial_backup}=    Get Future Backup Name For Current Boot
    Create Backup    ${initial_backup}    ${TRUE}

    TestAgent.Add Action For Next Deployment    1    fail_greenboot

    # We don't expect a rollback here since after the first failure
    # MicroShift should continue with business as usual
