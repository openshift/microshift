*** Test Cases ***
Unknown Log Level Produces Warning
    [Documentation]    Logs should warn that the log level setting is unknown
    Setup With Bad Log Level
    Pattern Should Appear In Log Output    ${CURSOR}    Unrecognized log level "unknown-value", defaulting to "Normal"

Debug Log Level Produces No Warning
    [Documentation]    Logs should not warn that the log level setting is unknown

Config Flags Are Logged in Audit Flags
    [Documentation]    Check that flags specified in the MicroShift audit config are passed to and logged by the
    ...    kube-apiserver. It is not essential that we test the kube-apiserver functionality as that is
    ...    already rigorously tested by upstream k8s and by OCP.
    Setup Audit Flags
    Pattern Should Appear In Log Output    ${CURSOR}    FLAG: --audit-log-maxsize=\"1000\"
