Restarting MicroShift In The Middle Of Startup Should Succeed

Restart MicroShift ${time_to_wait} Seconds After Starting

Restarting MicroShift Should Be Successful On First Try
    [Documentation]    Restarts MicroShift without additional retries, so
    ...    MicroShift will have one chance to shutdown and restart correctly.
    ...    Although normally (on boot) systemd attempts to start service
    ...    several times, here it is expected that single attempt is enough.

    ...    systemctl restart microshift

    ...    return_stderr=True
    ...    return_rc=True

Start MicroShift Without Waiting For Systemd Readiness
    [Documentation]    Starts MicroShift without waiting for daemon readiness
    ...    (which happens after all internal services/components declare ready
    ...    (close ready channel)), so it can be interrupted (restarted) mid startup.

    ${stdout}    ${stderr}    ${rc}=    Execute Command
    ...    systemctl start microshift --no-block
