# TODO: Replace this by a RHEL 9.8 image when its RPM repositories are released.
# Bootc Image Builder has a limitation does not allowing it to build ISO images
# from containers that use repositories protected by credentials. Thus, we build
# from the test agent container image which uses proxy for accessing repositories.
