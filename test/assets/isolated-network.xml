  <!-- An isolated network would ideally have no forwarding. We are using
       NAT here because Quay registry for mirroring requires traffic forwarding
       between private IPs in the hypervisor. In order to create the isolation a
       nwfilter is used to mimick the forward mode none that should be here. Only
       private IPs and DHCP are allowed. See isolated-netfilter.xml -->
