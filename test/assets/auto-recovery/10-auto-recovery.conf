OnFailure=microshift-auto-recovery.service
# Increase StartLimitInterval from default 10s to 25s to accomodate slower systems.
# Systemd will mark service as failed when it restarts StartLimitBurst amount
# (default is 5) within specified StartLimitInterval.
# In CI env, MicroShift restarts within ~1.3 seconds from a start, so 5 restarts
# fit in 10 seconds.
# In QE env, MicroShift needed around ~2.5 seconds to restart, so the
# StartLimitBurst (5) wasn't reached within 10 seconds. That resulted in systemd
# never marking microshift.service as failed (it kept restarting several hundred times)
# and the OnFailure= service not getting triggered.
# Add RestartSec=10s for microshift, every time the microshift need more than 10s to Restart.
# So the 25s is not enough anymore, expand this to 75s(10s * 5 times + 25s).
StartLimitIntervalSec=75s
