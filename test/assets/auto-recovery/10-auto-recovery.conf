OnFailure=microshift-auto-recovery.service
# Increase StartLimitInterval from default 10s to 25s to accomodate slower systems.
# Systemd will mark service as failed when it restarts StartLimitBurst amount
# (default is 5) within specified StartLimitInterval.
# In CI env, MicroShift restarts within ~1.3 seconds from a start, so 5 restarts
# fit in 10 seconds.
# In QE env, MicroShift needed around ~2.5 seconds to restart, so the
# StartLimitBurst (5) wasn't reached within 10 seconds. That resulted in systemd
# never marking microshift.service as failed (it kept restarting several hundred times)
# and the OnFailure= service not getting triggered.
