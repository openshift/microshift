# IPv6 only feature. An IPv6 VM will use DHCPv6 to get an IP address. To identify itself to a DHCP
# server it uses something called DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID), and based on that the DHCP server
# will issue a lease for that DUID and MAC address. When the system boots into anaconda to install
# the OS with kickstart files, the DUID is automatically generated. After the system boots into the
# OS a new DUID may be generated, causing DHCP to identify the VM as a new system, thus allocating
# a new IP address. In order to avoid this, the DUID generated during the installarion is saved and
# configured in NetworkManager to use it when the system boots into the OS.
# The DUID is extracted from the journal logs to avoid pinning to a specific NIC name (which would
# use nmcli commands).
