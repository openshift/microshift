First Failed Staged Upgrade Should Restore Backup
    [Documentation]    Staged deployment is unhealthy on first boot. After auto-greenboot-reboot MicroShift
    ...    should restore rollback deployment's backup to reattempt the upgrade from healthy data.

    Wait For Healthy System

    ${initial_backup}=    Get Future Backup Name For Current Boot
    Create Backup    ${initial_backup}    ${TRUE}

    TestAgent.Add Action For Next Deployment    1    fail_greenboot

    # We don't expect a rollback here since after the first failure
    # things should continue as desired. This test validates the
    # restore function is working when the first boot is unhealthy.

    Wait For Healthy System

    Validate Backup Is Restored    ${initial_backup}
