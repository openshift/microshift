# Contributing to MicroShift

If you would like to develop MicroShift locally, you can follow this guide on getting
it installed and running through the provided Makefile.

This guide will primarily focus on running MicroShift within a VM using Vagrant.


## (optional) Developing with Vagrant

To get started with development, it is recommended to use Vagrant for VM provisioning,
however it is not necessary.

You can find a guide on how to install it for your system [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads). 

Once Vagrant is installed, you will need to create a Vagrant box for the operating
system of your choice. For this example we will be looking at a [fedora 34 cloud
image](https://app.vagrantup.com/fedora/boxes/34-cloud-base), however you can substitute any vagrant image of your choice.


First, navigate to the MicroShift directory on your host system, or another designated
directory where we will be storing the Vagrantfile.



Next, download the vagrant image. For this example we will use
a fedora 34 cloud image:

```sh
vagrant box add fedora/34-cloud-base
```

Depending on the image, Vagrant will ask you to select a Virtualization provider,
just select the first one.

Once that downloads, initialize the repository for launching your image:

```
vagrant init fedora/34-cloud-base
```

Running this command will create a `Vagrantfile` in your working directory which
is used to configure your vagrant box.

Before we start our Vagrant box, we will need to increase the amount of RAM available
to the system. 
To do this, edit the Vagrantfile and configure your provider settings to include
the following:

```rb
    config.vm.provider "libvirt" do |v|
        # provides 3GB of memory
        v.memory = 3072
        # for parallelization
        v.cpus = 2
    end
```

The value of `config.vm.provider` depends on the provider you selected when you
ran `vagrant add` earlier. For example, if you selected virtualbox then the first
line should be: `config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|`


Now we can start the VM:

```
vagrant up
```

Once the VM is up, connect to it:

```
vagrant ssh
```

### (Extra Optional) Connecting VSCode to Vagrant 

If you're using VSCode, you can connect to your vagrant box with a few extra steps.

#### Increasing Memory Requirements

Since VS Code leans more on the heavy side of development, the RAM usage on your Vagrant environment 
can go up to 5GB, and therefore we will need to modify the `Vagrantfile` to
increase the amount of available RAM from 3GB to 5GB (or 6GB if you want to be safe). 
To do this, set `v.memory` to the following in your `Vagrantfile`:

```rb
        # provides 5GB of memory
        v.memory = 5120
        # provides 6GB of memory
        v.memory = 6144
```

#### Setting up an SSH Profile

First we need to ask Vagrant for an SSH config file. From your host machine, run:

```
vagrant ssh-config > ssh-config.conf
```

*You can edit the `ssh-config.conf` file to change the hostname from `default` to
`vagrant` to be more easily identifiable, but that's up to you. :)*

Here's an example of my working SSH config file:
```
Host default
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant
  Port 2222
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile /path/to/microshift/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL
```


Next, you'll want to install the `Remote - SSH` extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)



With the extension installed, you'll click on the green bottom in the bottom-left
corner of VSCode to open a dropdown menu for SSH options:

![VSCode Remote Button](./docs/pics/vscode-remote-button.png)

Select the option to open an SSH configuration file:
![Dropdown Menu](./docs/pics/remote-ssh-dropdown.png)

Next you'll want to navigate to the "Remote Explorer" tab on the left-hand side
of VSCode, then select on the vagrant target (default if you haven't renamed it)
and click on the button to connect to it in a remote window.

## Running MicroShift Locally

### Pre-Installation

You will need to install the required binaries:
- git
- make
- golang
- glibc
- podman

```sh
# Fedora/CentOS 
sudo dnf install \
    git \
    make \
    golang \    
    glibc-static

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install \
    git \
    build-essential \   # provides Make
    golang-go \
    glibc
```

To install podman, you can find the appropriate guide for your respective system:
[Install Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)


Next you'll want to clone the repository and cd into it: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/redhat-et/microshift.git
cd microshift
```

### Building MicroShift

Now we can build MicroShift:

```sh
make build
CONFIG_ENV_ONLY=true ./install.sh
sudo ./microshift run 
```
