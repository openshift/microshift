## Enhancement Proposals

MicroShift’s goal is to create a minimal core that can functionally operate as close to OpenShift as 
possible while maintaining a low resource impact. We are always looking for enhancement proposals, 
so feel free to create an enhancement issue with a link to a document that explains your proposal. 
The enhancement will be considered as long as it aligns with [MicroShift's design goals](https://github.com/redhat-et/microshift/blob/main/docs/design/design.md).
