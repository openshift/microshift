  - bdf1b23 2024-02-13T17:47:15+01:00 Namespace address sets don't have hostNetwork pod ips, while Network Policies do add hostNetwork pods to their own address sets. An attempt to unify this behaviour ended up breaking customers relying on the previous logic, so we have to keep it. The logic on when to use namespace address sets was restored. It is applied when podSelector is nil. That means that peer ``` to:     - namespaceSelector: <ns selector> ``` won't include hostNetwork pods, while peer ``` to:     - namespaceSelector: <ns selector>       podSelector: {} ``` will. You can find 2 new unit tests verifying this behaviour.
