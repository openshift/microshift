  - 7c21e8f 2023-07-05T09:31:21+02:00 Fix acl sync to properly filter default deny acls. ExternalIDs[defaultDenyPolicyTypeACLExtIdKey] is also used by multicast acls (despite the name), but multicast acl have different priorities. It was not a bug, because multicast acls are updated before default deny, therefore only default deny acls will match the criteria. This commit just makes the filtering more specific.

  - 5e3dc65 2023-06-29T09:47:46+02:00 Allow hostNetwork ingress for network policies with empty namespace selector. The previous version used shared address sets for empty namespace selector to reuse the address set, but it didn't include a special config.Kubernetes.HostNetworkNamespace that only has an address set, but no pods. This difference may break existing network policies for hostNetwork pods, therefore we explicitly add this address sets for an empty namespace selector.
