  - 7f1cdd9 2023-08-24T10:40:19+02:00 Update apbroute Status check to allow notFound errors between retries, since it fetches the object from the informer cache which is not guaranteed to contain the object immediately after Create() call.
  - 088c1ac 2023-08-24T10:40:19+02:00 NetworkControllerManager doesn't use given identity, remove.
  - b2b25af 2023-08-24T10:40:19+02:00 After changing apbroute controller startup sequence, one test started failing. The problem is annotation-based and CR-based configs had different BFD settings. Before the change external_gw code always handled annotations before apbroute controller handled CRD, and annotation-based config took place, now with the change CR-based config is applied before. Add 2 explicit test cases for both handling orders to make sure the config will be the same.
  - 2792d74 2023-08-24T10:40:19+02:00 Add APBRoute factory to the WatchFactory to share it between ovnkube-controller and ovnkube-node.
  - bc8997f 2023-08-24T10:40:15+02:00 Add ovnkube-controller-with-node mode. ovnkube-controller and ovnkube-node depend on each other to start up, therefore they are run in parallel (but also to speed up the startup)
  - 2c252f1 2023-08-22T17:13:16+02:00 Create egress firewall with one db transaction. Update cleanup test to have dns-based address set as a leftover, since all acls are commited in one transaction now.
