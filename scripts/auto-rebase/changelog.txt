  - f94332f 2023-11-03T10:33:44+01:00 Update egress firewall to use namespaced port group instead of cluster port group + address set match to reduce the number of OVS flows. Previously, all EF ACLs were applied to the clusterPortGroup, and matched source on address set. In that case, all node will have the same set of OVS flows, matching sources that are not scheduled on that node at all. When using port group as a source match, only flow for local ports will be present on every node. The port group is created, updated and deleted by namespace handler similar to the namespace address set.
  - 5e9a5b3 2023-11-03T10:33:44+01:00 Move multicast port group management to the namespace similar to namespace address set. Existing port groups don't need any change, since port group name always was a namespace name. Set ErrNotFound to false for delete acls and ports from port group ops. Namespace handler will create, update and delete namespace port group similar to the namespace address set.

  - fc3ff2f 2023-10-26T09:24:00+02:00 Update leaderelection config to allow retries for an overloaded cluster. With the previous params we only allowed 1 retry in case tryAcquireOrRenew failed within 10 seconds, and no retry otherwise. When etcd is overloaded, lease requests may timeout in 10 seconds, and that will result in giving up the leadership without retry.
