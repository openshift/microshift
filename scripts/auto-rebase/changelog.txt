  - ad665ccf 2024-10-09T10:00:23+02:00 Cleanup gateway pod for remote zone. For local zone pods, deleteLogicalPort cleans this up, but before IC this function was called for all non-host-network pods, hence this logic. After IC, deleteLogicalPort won't be called for all remote zone pods, so condition is not needed.
  - 645deca4 2024-10-09T10:00:09+02:00 Add egress gateway e2e test option to delete gateway pod instead of re-labeling gateway pod. It uses different handlers for update and delete pod internally. Remove external.gateway from the dual-stack exclusion, as it is supported for ipv6.
