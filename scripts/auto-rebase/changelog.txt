  - a435a4ab 2024-10-28T16:23:23-04:00 Add support for cachi2 based deps Konflux is replacing RH's internal build system OSBS. OSBS supported a build-time dependency injection system called "cachito". Konflux replaces this with "cachi2" which works differently. REMOTE_SOURCES no longer need to be copied into place and there is no need to source cachito's environment information (Konflux automatically rewrites the Dockerfile to source cachi2/cachi2.env before running the original RUN commands). Additionally, cachito appears to have provided go.sum dependencies whereas cachi2 requires all build-time dependencies in go.mod. Missing dependencies are added to go.mod as // indirect in this change.
