c5e0b8e5e20399aa9c4d3ea405ec4b436a928f34 2023-06-23T21:23:23+02:00 Add default deny acl externalID to avoid duplicate acls for namespaces with long names. every namespace has 4 default deny acls: ingress/egress and deny/allow. Direction was in the ExternalIDs before, but action was a suffix in acl name, that gets truncated for long namespace names, therefore deny and allow acls for the same direction would have the same name and ExternalIDs. New ExternalID should fix this case.
