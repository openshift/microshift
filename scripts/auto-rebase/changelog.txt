  - 96b7803 2023-07-12T16:22:02+02:00 WaitForCacheSync function takes stopChannel as an argument, and it will retry syncing cache until it is closed. If we just use ovn-kube stop channel, it will never return an error (it will never return until either the cache is synced, or stopChannel is closed). To fix it, GetChildStopChanWithTimeout and some wrappers functions passing this channel with timeout were added. The default cache sync timeout is 20 seconds (with reflector exponential backoff it means 4 list() retries). If any informer failed to list its resource withing a given time period, return error to make the problem visible.

The correct way to start service controller was oc.svcFactory.Start(oc.stopChan) oc.StartServiceController(oc.wg, true)) Now it is just oc.StartServiceController(oc.wg, true)) since factory is shared. Running service controller will create Chassis_Template_Var for existing nodes, update addNodeLogicalFlows.
  - f64c91a 2023-07-05T15:58:16+02:00 Update service controller to use sharedInformerFactory from the default controller. It decreases kube-apiserver load and memory footprint, because service controller used to create its own SharedInformerFactory for Nodes, Services and EndpointSlices.
