8513b38e5a74c0c5f303dca30a27e6cc24bdf89c 2023-03-24T16:52:21+01:00 update to before-kube-1.26 bump
46d2b9e1a902cfde6ed0a85251b336f60b0876b6 2023-03-23T17:26:47+01:00 don't create acl if no namespace address sets are selected. Previously "ip4.dst == {}" match was created, and ovn-controller throws an error on such acl
7ab410d18906602b127ae54fc49fb9e70d80ba03 2023-03-23T17:26:40+01:00 Add PodSelectorAddressSet tests.
efa8741efd682bca78571cc71f0a5cb94e71449b 2023-03-23T17:26:34+01:00 Rework gressPolicy ACLs build: previously all gress policies with at least one selector had peerAddressSet, and empty gress (allow all) was identified by "gp.sizeOfAddressSet() > 0". Now we don't create address sets like that, therefore a new hasPeerSelector field was added to distinguish empty gress from the one that just doesn't have any address sets added yet.
e0c35b2619f4084a0babea4aa554f5018e52ef5a 2023-03-23T17:26:26+01:00 Add PodSelectorAddressSet object, that should be used to manage address sets for pod selector (network policy object is only responsible for local pods and peer namespace-only handlers). The locking mechanism is copied from networkPolicy.
4a03b84b53431d8147818f311bba63ea78d2a6dc 2023-03-23T17:26:19+01:00 Unlock shared default deny port group early, when no db changes required, to unlock other handlers from the same namespace.
06c9270dc3c69e8128d57a42b8def7b51ab1bbf8 2023-03-23T17:25:41+01:00 Add an option to enable scale metrics in kind
6d96be9e761aa544c3500c54508a61c102dbdd77 2023-03-23T17:25:30+01:00 Add MetricMasterSyncDuration metric to track how much it takes for ovn-k master to start watching every resource. Add scale metrics for network policies, rename existing enable-eip-scale-metrics flag to more general enable-scale-metrics, and use it for network policy metric too.
