  - c0a9387 2025-04-02T16:25:36+02:00 Keep ovn ipsec enabled during the upgrade     The following change on the machine pool `status.MachineCount == status.UpdatedMachineCount && hasSourceInMachineConfigStatus(status, machineConfigs)` is introduced with PR https://github.com/openshift/cluster-network-operator/pull/2349 which ensures IPsec machine config is always installed on all the nodes in the cluster, So this is deleting the IPsec daemonset as per the CNO state machine for IPsec when the condition is not met. But this is also accidentally disabling IPsec in OVN which is not an expected behavior. This causes ovs-monitor-ipsec to refresh existing ipsec connections unnecessarily when IPsec pod comes up as it is not able to find remote_name from the tunnel. This may also trigger deleting IPsec connection entries from openshift.conf file if ovs-monitor-ipsec is not killed timely when ipsec daemonset is removed. So this commit enables ovn ipsec option as long as the API is set with Full mode.
