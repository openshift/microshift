172552ee9547d502fd71a4495af17a51a0945811 2023-07-07T12:15:14+02:00 Allow hostNetwork ingress for network policies with empty namespace selector. The previous version used shared address sets for empty namespace selector to reuse the address set, but it didn't include a special config.Kubernetes.HostNetworkNamespace that only has an address set, but no pods. This difference may break existing network policies for hostNetwork pods, therefore we explicitly add this address sets for an empty namespace selector.
