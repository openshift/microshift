  - 457c5c4 2024-01-15T13:17:20+01:00 Update namespace-owned port group (that used to be managed by multicast) to only create port group if it doesn't exist and don't update ports or acls, since they should be updated by other handlers (pod/multicast/ egressfirewall/etc). Add namespace and pod unit tests to cover new port group functionality.
