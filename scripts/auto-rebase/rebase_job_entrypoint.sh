# LVMS is not tracked in the OCP release image.  Instead, rely on the latest X.Y stream as the release image.
#  LVMS also does not cut nightly releases where ocp-release does.  This means that latest ocp-releases' y-stream
#  can increment independently from LVMS, and will usually be 1 y-stream ahead of LVMS in-between OCP releases.
#  For example, ocp-release at 4.13 will more often than not correspond to 4.12 LVMS, until the official 4.13 release when
#  both components will be 4.13.
