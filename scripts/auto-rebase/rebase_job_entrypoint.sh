# LVMS is not tracked in the OCP release image.  Instead, rely on the
#  latest X.Y stream as the release image.  LVMS also does not cut
#  nightly releases where ocp-release does.  This means that latest
#  ocp-releases' y-stream can increment independently from LVMS, and
#  will usually be 1 y-stream ahead of LVMS in-between OCP releases.
#  For example, ocp-release at 4.13 will more often than not
#  correspond to 4.12 LVMS, until the official 4.13 release when both
#  components will be 4.13.
release_lvms="v4.13.1-5"

# Since LVMS is not part of the release payload, it is not kept in
# CI. Use the latest z-stream that coincides with the release
# payload's X.Y version
